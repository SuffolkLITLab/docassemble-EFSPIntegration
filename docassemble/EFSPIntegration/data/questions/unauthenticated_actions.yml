  Question and code blocks that are useful for preforming Tyler e-filing
  actions while unauthenticated, i.e. not logged in as an e-filing user

  These include
  * new user registration / account creation
  * resetting a password
  * resending an activation email

  To use, you need to define `jurisdiction_id`, to be the jurisdiction you are
  using. For example, "massachusetts", or "illinois".

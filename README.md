# docassemble-EFSPIntegration

A docassemble extension that talks to [a proxy e-filing server](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/EfileProxyServer/) easily within a docassemble interview.

Main interviews of import:

* any_filing_interview.yml: allows you to make any type of filing, initial or subsequent
* admin_interview.yml: lets you handle admin / user functionality, outside of the context of cases and filings

In progress!
